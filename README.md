## Language Modeling From Scratch
[Repo](https://github.com/Yangliu20/language_modeling-basics)

This ongoing project builds a Transfomer-based language model end-to-end from scratch using PyTorch. Building blocks of language modeling include tokenizer, core model, optimizer, training pipeline, inference pipeline. The model is trained on TinyStories datasets. 

## ML Fashion Product Recommendation System
[Repo](https://github.com/Yangliu20/hm_personalization_recsys)

Here I built a personalized fashion product recommendation system using [H&M open-source datasets](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/h-and-m-personalized-fashion-recommendations/data). Specifically, it is a two-stage recommender system with hybrid candidate generators (collaborative & content-based filtering, trending-item heuristics) and a LightGBM ranking model, optimizing for top-N precision.


## Deployment of BERT and ViT models for real-time prediction as REST API
[Repo](https://github.com/Yangliu20/ml-e2e-deploy-fastapi)

This project builds an end-to-end ML pipeline to serve 3 finetuned models (BERT and ViT) as a REST API on AWS EC2 using Python and FastAPI, achieving functions including **sentiment analysis, disaster tweet classification, and human pose classification**. It is containerized with Docker and leverages Nginx for load balancing. An interactive Streamlit web application is also developed to serve the model by API requests through a user-friendly interface.

## Simple CNN from scratch with pure NumPy for image classification
[Repo](https://github.com/Yangliu20/cnn-numpy)

This project builds a simple convolutional neural network (CNN) from scratch using NumPy to classify handwritten digits in the well-known MNIST datasets. The code presents an end-to-end machine learning process, including image preprocessing, model definition, model training, model validation and inference. With a very simple model architecture it can achieve a decent test accuracy.

## Tetris game on Arduino
[Repo](https://github.com/Yangliu20/arduino-tetris)

This project implements a single-player Tetris game (one of my favorite childhood games!) on Arduino, using an 8Ã—8 LED matrix as the display and an infrared sensor for controls. It supports all essential Tetris mechanics, including horizontal movement, block rotation, and accelerated dropping.

Check this demo!
