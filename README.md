# Simple CNN from scratch with pure NumPy for image classification
[Repo](https://github.com/Yangliu20/cnn-numpy)

This project builds a simple convolutional neural network (CNN) from scratch using NumPy to classify handwritten digits in the well-known MNIST datasets. The code presents an end-to-end machine learning process, including image preprocessing, model definition, model training, model validation and inference. With a very simple model architecture it can achieve a decent test accuracy.
