# Simple CNN from scratch with pure NumPy for image classification
Repo: https://github.com/Yangliu20/cnn-numpy

This project builds a simple convolutional neural network (CNN) from scratch using NumPy to classify handwritten digits in the well-known MNIST datasets. The code presents an end-to-end machine learning process, including image preprocessing, model definition, model training, model validation and inference. Forward propagation and backward propagation are written from scratch using pure numpy.
