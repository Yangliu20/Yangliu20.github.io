## Simple CNN from scratch with pure NumPy for image classification
[Repo](https://github.com/Yangliu20/cnn-numpy)

This project builds a simple convolutional neural network (CNN) from scratch using NumPy to classify handwritten digits in the well-known MNIST datasets. The code presents an end-to-end machine learning process, including image preprocessing, model definition, model training, model validation and inference. With a very simple model architecture it can achieve a decent test accuracy.

## Tetris game on Arduino
[Repo](https://github.com/Yangliu20/arduino-tetris)

This project implements a single-player Tetris game (one of my favorite childhood games!) on Arduino, using an 8Ã—8 LED matrix as the display and an infrared sensor for controls. It supports all essential Tetris mechanics, including horizontal movement, block rotation, and accelerated dropping.

Check this demo!
